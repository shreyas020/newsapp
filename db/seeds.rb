# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# catalogs = [{name: "Bollywood", ctype: "gallery"},
#             {name: "Tollywood", ctype: "gallery"},
#             {name: "Sandalwood News", ctype: "article"},
#             {name: "Nation Polls", ctype: "poll"}]
# catalogs.each do |catalog|
#   Catalog.create!(catalog)
